# INTcoin
## Quantum-Resistant Cryptocurrency

**Built for the Quantum Era**

---

## What is INTcoin?

INTcoin is a next-generation cryptocurrency designed to resist attacks from quantum computers. While other cryptocurrencies remain vulnerable to future quantum threats, INTcoin uses **NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography** to ensure your funds remain secure—today and tomorrow.

---

## The Quantum Threat

Quantum computers pose an existential threat to traditional cryptocurrencies:

- **Bitcoin & Ethereum** use ECDSA signatures → **Vulnerable** to Shor's algorithm
- **Current encryption** can be broken in hours by future quantum computers
- **Your funds are at risk** once quantum computers become practical (est. 2030-2035)

**INTcoin solves this problem today.**
